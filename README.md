Radio-Playlists
===============

This repository contains two playlists. The one is in xspf format (very well defined) and the other one is in M3U (probably one of the most widely used). They contain the most common Greek-Cypriot and two pure Greek <b>online radio stations</b>. They can be played flawlessly in various players including my favorite media player namely VLC.

If your player supports XSPF I would definitely recommend to use that one, as the xspf playlist contains useful information for each online radio station as its link, its name, its description AND a <i>cover picture!</i>. If not, just go for the M3U one!

I have included an xspf playlist, as xspf format is well defined, supports a cover picture per track/stream and allows multiple locations per each station (this  is very important if your machine has limited variety of codecs or your player does not support playing a few types of streaming files).

I have no rights over the source providers or the pictures. These are just a two playlist, containing the same radio stations, created for my ease. As I suppose it will be useful for other people as well, I decided to share it.

Please find more about xspf standard <a href="http://xspf.org/">here</a>. The applications that are capable of playing this format can be found <a href="http://xspf.org/applications/">here</a>. I have also created an M3U playlist, in case your player does not support XSPF. 

<b>Just download one of the playlists, open it and there you are! You can listen to the radio station you like!</b>

Feel free to download the libraries, and modify them. You can also rearrange the tracks(xspf)/links(m3u) if you want.

If any of the links is dead, either any station's cover picture, or any station's source, you can inform me anytime :)

Enjoy ;)
